# Full stack app with React and rest-API
 Unit 10 Final Project Treehouse Full Stack Techdegree


 In this final project, I have used React to create a client for my existing school database REST API. The full stack application will provide a way for users to administer a school database containing information about courses: users can interact with the database by retrieving a list of courses, viewing detail for a specific course, as well as creating, updating and deleting courses in the database.

In addition, the project will require users to create an account and sign in to make changes to the database. 

To complete this project, I have used my knowledge of React, JSX, React Router, React Context API, and Create React App.

After using the Create React App tool to set up the initial project, I have:

- Used JavaScript and JSX to build out the components for the application in a modular fashion.
- Used React Router to set up routes.
- Used the Fetch API to fetch data from the REST API.
- Allowed users to sign up and use basic authentication to support users signing in.
- Added to the supplied CSS to personalize the project.
